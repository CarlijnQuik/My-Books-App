Choices in technicalities;
- Chose to edit the layouts myself instead of looking for themes etc.
- Chose to create a custom menu instead of using for instance a different type of activity with a menu button. This is because in the previous psets those activities were not used. When creating the next App, I will consider using a different type of menu. This might also be better to avoid having to use fragments without the code becoming less efficient. I am aware of the fact that the setMenu() function could be general if I would do that. I was told fragmants are too hard to learn for now so I stuck with this function.

For signing in, the Firebase QuickStart example is used with a bit of editing as well as the documentation on this topic.

For help with getting started with the chosen OpenLibrary API, took a look at this demo and took over some of the methods used. In particular, on what links to sent the HTTP requests to. Later found out more request types on my own. If I took over code, it was because it turned out to be the most efficient way, I never simply copied any code and you will notice there are limited similarities to my App and the one in the tutorial.
