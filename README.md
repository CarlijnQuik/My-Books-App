Choices in technicalities;
- Kept elevation for devices with API level 21 and higher.
- Due to time limitation chose to edit the layouts myself instead of looking for themes etc.

For signing in, the Firebase QuickStart example is used with a bit of editing as well as the documentation on this topic.

For help with getting started with the chosen OpenLibrary API, took a look at this demo and took over some of the methods used. In particular, on what links to sent the HTTP requests to. Later found out more request types on my own. If I took over code, it was because it turned out to be the most efficient way, I never simply copied any code and you will notice there are limited similarities to my App and the one in the tutorial.
