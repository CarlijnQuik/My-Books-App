# Peer Review - Problem Set 6: Your own
### Names
<b>Level:</b> 2<br/>
<b>Feedback: </b>
Names could sometimes be more precise. Sometimes a name is taken straight from the example, you could improve by giving it a name that is more descriptive of your use.

### Headers
<b>Level:</b> 4<br/>
<b>Feedback: </b>Nothing much to mention here. Headers above the files too.

### Comments
<b>Level:</b> 3<br/>
<b>Feedback: </b>
The comments are not consistent. Capitals and dots are often forgotten (or added).

### Layout
<b>Level:</b> 4<br/>
<b>Feedback: </b>
Whitespaces and indents are pretty much consistent between files. Sometimes the code is more cluttered than my liking but I do believe this is a personal preference. Other than that, it looks easily readable.

### Formatting
<b>Level:</b> 4<br/>
<b>Feedback: </b>Solid.

### Flow
<b>Level:</b> 3<br/>
<b>Feedback: </b>Most important pieces of code/functions are often early in the code. This makes it more easy for me to read. Sometimes a function is called that contains two/three strings. This makes it a bit harder to 'flow' through the code.

### Idiom
<b>Level:</b> 2<br/>
<b>Feedback: </b>There is duplicate code where it could have been more generic. E.g. setMenu() or the AsyncTasks

### Expressions
<b>Level:</b> 3<br/>
<b>Feedback: </b>Apart from a few like `dataRef.child("Users").child(user.getUid()).child("Books").child(book.firebasekey).setValue(book);`

### Decomposition
<b>Level:</b> 3<br/>
<b>Feedback: </b> No big blocks of complex code. It's well spread out and divided.

### Modularization
<b>Level:</b> 3<br/>
<b>Feedback: </b>Sometimes it feels too cluttered (with modules).
